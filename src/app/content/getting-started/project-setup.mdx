# Project Setup

Before adding AeriUI components, you’ll need to set up your project to work with AeriUI’s system. This page will cover the setup steps, including creating a `cn` function, adding the required `css` styles, and configuring the `aeriui.json` file. The setup process has been made simple through the CLI, which will handle most of the work for you.

## CLI 

Setting up your project to work with aeriui has been made extremely simple with the CLI command:

```bash
npx aeriui@latest init
```

This command will ask a series of questions to determine your preferences, then make the required changes to your project for you.

The exact changes made to your project will be:

- Add required css variables and tailwind classes to your specified `styles.css` file.
- Create a `cn` function and place it in a specified directory.
- Create an `aeriui.json` file, so that components are placed in the correct directory and use the correct file paths specified by you.
- If desired, setup an alias, such as `@aeriui`, to the specified directory that components will be placed in.
