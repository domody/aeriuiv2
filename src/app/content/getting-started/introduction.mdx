# Introduction

**aeriui** is a free and open-source UI component library for React, built with **Tailwind CSS** and **Class Variance Authority (CVA)**. It provides a growing collection of clean, reusable, and themeable components designed for consistency, ease of use, and full developer control.

Unlike many UI libraries, **aeriui** is built entirely in plain React with zero external dependencies (e.g., Radix, Framer Motion). Every component is fully open-source, unabstracted, and easily modifiable; giving you complete visibility into how things work under the hood.

## Why aeriui?

This project is inspired by [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com), not as a fork, replacement, or competitor, but as a **personal learning exercise** with production-quality standards. The goal is to build components that are:

- **Simple by default** - minimal styling, clean structure, easy to read
- **Extensible by design** - built for real-world apps, not just demos
- **Fully accessible** - no compromises on semantics or keyboard support
- **Unopinionated** - you can use the defaults or fully customize every detail
- **Dark mode ready** - all components support light/dark themes via Tailwind tokens

Where libraries like shadcn/ui often rely on abstracted primitives from Radix or other dependencies, **aeriui** builds everything from scratch. No hidden logic, no third-party layers, and no surprises. You can read and modify the code directly, or drop it into your project as-is.

## Tailwind-first theming

All components use Tailwind tokens for theming and styling. Want to change the look and feel of your entire app? Just update your Tailwind config, and your aeriui components will follow suit. Prefer a completely different design system? You can easily adjust or replace the component styling directly in code.

## Who is this for?

- **Developers who want full control** over how their UI behaves and looks
- **Teams who value transparency** and need to build on top of simple, readable code
- **Learners and tinkerers** looking to understand UI patterns deeply through practical examples
- **Production-ready projects** that want lightweight, maintainable components without sacrificing quality

## A project for learning, built with care

This is a personal project by [Dom Ody](https://domody.vercel.app), built to push my skills, challenge assumptions, and create something that others might actually use. Itâ€™s not meant to compete with larger, more mature UI libraries - but it *is* built to be useful, usable, and clean.
