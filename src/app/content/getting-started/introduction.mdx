# Introduction to AeriUI

Welcome to **AeriUI**, a minimal and customizable UI library designed to help you build beautiful, consistent interfaces with ease. Whether you're looking for a complete design system or just need a few components, AeriUI has you covered.

## Key Features

### 1. **No Installation Required**
AeriUI is designed to be easy to use right out of the box. All components can be fully copy-pasted from the site into your project with no installation required. No need to worry about prerequisites such as Radix UI or other dependencies. Of course, if you'd like, you can also install the library using npm for a more streamlined setup:

```
npm install aeriui
```

### 2. **Customizable Styling**
One of the standout features of AeriUI is its flexibility. You can easily change the entire theme by adjusting the theme colors, or customize individual components directly in your code. The styling is set up so that you can modify component styles on the fly as you copy and paste the code into your project. This makes it quick to adapt to your design requirements without the need for complex configuration.

- **Change the entire theme** by modifying the theme colors.
- **Edit individual components' styles** directly as the code is copied into your project.

### 3. **Minimal, Consistent Design**
AeriUI embraces a minimalistic design approach, providing a clean and consistent user experience across all components. Each component is designed with simplicity in mind, ensuring that your application maintains a cohesive look and feel, while still being highly customizable to suit your branding.

## Getting Started

You can start using AeriUI today without any installation. Simply copy the component code from the documentation, paste it into your project, and you're good to go!
